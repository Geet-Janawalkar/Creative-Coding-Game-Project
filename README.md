# Creative-Coding-Game-Project

A standard space invaders game that I had created for an assessment item for a Griffith University ICT course called Creative Coding.

Current known bugs:
- Has a sprite deloading bug where the code doesn't properly remove them from memory, I think it might be more of a p5 limitation. Fortunately while Github pages does solve this, you can tell it's running out of memory because the sound effects turn horrid after several rounds, otherwise if you download it it will take up a certain portion of memory until Chrome crashes. Happy shooting!
